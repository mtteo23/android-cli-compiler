This is a simple sample project that permits easily creating android apps (apk) without using a large IDE like android studio.

First run the ./install.sh script to install all the tools you should need

Then you can alredy ./build.sh your first project to test the enviroment!

If you want to test the file you created you can run "./build.sh test", but in order for that to work you need to:
connect via USB the android phone you want to test on
set it in "developer mode" (go to settings>info phone>info software> click seven times on build version)
in developer options you have to enable USB debug
consent to the various pop-up
run the script

If you have any problem feel free to contact me!
